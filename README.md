# Encrypted Deep Learning
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks to understand the concept of Encrypted Deep Learning. 
Or usage of [Homomorphic Encryption](https://www.wired.com/2014/11/hacker-lexicon-homomorphic-encryption/) to encrypt a Neural Network.


## Dependencies
The only required dependency is NumPy.

### Futher Exploration
For further exploration don't forget to checkout [OpenMined](https://github.com/OpenMined)'s work on Homomorphically Encrypting Deep Learning Models.
